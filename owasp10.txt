Title	Description
SC01 - Access Control Vulnerabilities	Access control flaws allow unauthorized users or roles to invoke privileged functions or modify critical state, often leading to full protocol compromise when admin, governance, or upgrade paths are exposed.
SC02 - Business Logic Vulnerabilities	Design-level flaws in lending, AMM, reward, or governance logic that break intended economic or functional rules, enabling attackers to extract value even when low-level checks appear correct.
SC03 - Price Oracle Manipulation	Weak oracles and unsafe price integrations that let attackers skew reference prices, enabling under-collateralized borrowing, unfair liquidations, and mispriced swaps as part of larger exploit chains.
SC04 - Flash Loan–Facilitated Attacks	Attacks that use large, uncollateralized flash loans to magnify small bugs (in logic, pricing, or arithmetic) into large drains, by executing complex multi-step sequences in a single transaction.
SC05 - Lack of Input Validation	Missing or weak validation of user, admin, or cross-chain inputs that allows unsafe parameters to reach core logic, corrupting state, breaking assumptions, or enabling direct fund loss.
SC06 - Unchecked External Calls	Unsafe interactions with external contracts or addresses where failures, reverts, or callbacks are not safely handled, often enabling reentrancy or inconsistent state.
SC07 - Arithmetic Errors	Subtle bugs in integer math, scaling, and rounding; especially in share, interest, and AMM calculations; that can be repeatedly exploited to cause precision loss, or siphon value, particularly when paired with flash loans.
SC08 - Reentrancy Attacks	Situations where external calls can re-enter vulnerable functions before state is fully updated, allowing repeated withdrawals or state changes from outdated views of contract state.
SC09 - Integer Overflow and Underflow	Dangerous arithmetic on platforms or code paths without robust overflow checks, leading to wrapped values, broken invariants, and potential drains of liquidity or mis-accounting.
SC10 - Proxy & Upgradeability Vulnerabilities	Misconfigured or weakly governed proxy, initialization, and upgrade mechanisms that let attackers seize control of implementations or reinitialize critical state.
